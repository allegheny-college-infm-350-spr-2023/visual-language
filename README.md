## Summary

Further subdividing and nuancing the terminology of our course, we explore narrative as a technology and algorithmic structure. Thankfully, computational tools like GPT-3 do very well with combinations of prompt engineering and structural guidance. They may even be able to suggest narratives given some examples. However, what they're _don't judge_ is quality.

This is where _you_ come in.

## Goals

* Extending/refining our ability to practice prompt engineering to achieve specific higher-quality results
* Gaining an understanding of narrative as a function/technology of time at both high-level narrative (story) and event-driven narrative (plot)
* Discussing the ways in which models succeed or fail at creating equitable, fair, and representative stories
* Discovering other exploitable boundaries and what these offer

## Outcomes

* `1` text of at least `12` (panels) images which:
  * communicates a narrative (i.e. story or plot) visually
* entries of prompts used in the [prompt_journal.md](writing/prompt_journal.md) 

## Process

This assignment requires you to use the OpenAI library to access image generation at the scale and quality we need. The implementation
provided is complete.
